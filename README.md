# PV-Discord-Bot
A discord bot meant to automate a custom Tabletop Role Playing Game system, Project Vegas. Written in Python and utilizing SQLite, it tracks characters and enemies while combat progresses.

# Background
"Project Vegas" is the name of a TTRPG campaign ran by two friends of mine. While heavily inspired by the Persona series of video games, the combat system is complicated and too dense for typical TTRPG play. As such sessions get bogged down in the rules as players grow slowly frusterated. That is why the PV-Discord-Bot will take care of the battle system to streamline gameplay in order to improve the experience of Project Vegas.

# Purpose
The PV-Discord-Bot will handle all combat calculations and character stat management. It will not handle narrative components of gameplay. It will draw from a database of set characters to run combat encounters, allowing one controlling user to designate which actions characters take in combat. It will not be designed for multiple users to interact with at the same time.
